#Task
Your task is to build a web page to display information from a simple database of
exoplanets that is being exposed by a set of Spring REST repositories which are
exposed from the URL in the resources section of this document.
The web page should be built in a modern interactive javascript framework. A
basic page illustrating the functionality should take no more than a few hours.
You are welcome to embellish the pages and data however you want to show off
your skills.
The definition is deliberately open ended on specifics, and does not include any
tricks / gotchas, so you are at liberty to deliver the requirement using a
display/layout/formatting that you feel best displays the data.
The repositories have sufficient methods to perform all the required tasks but
they may not be in the most helpful form.

2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to download all dependencies 
2. Run `yarn start` to run App on `http://localhost:3000`
