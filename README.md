#Task
1. Create a table of recommendations from the data provided (60 mins). If time
permits, implement interactive elements. The design can be straight forward: the
columns provided in the file can be kept as they are, visual elements can be added
to show e.g. the level of access or the type of messaging. The design team have
provided an example (page 4) of how theyâ€™d expect this to be laid out, but feel free to
get creative.
2. Visualise the rep performance data provided. You are welcome to do this however
you like, but the design team have provided a hastily-drawn wireframe which may
help guide your work (see last page). You only have 90 minutes for this task, so you
aren't expected to finish everything.
3. Given that your time has been limited to work on this project, make some brief notes
outlining how you would proceed if you had more time (15 mins).
